# RAT-Remote-Acccess-Trojan-
The server script listens for incoming connections from a client, receives commands from the user, and sends them to the client for execution. The output of the command is then received from the client and displayed on the server console. 
The client script connects to the server and waits for commands from the server. When a command is received, it is executed, and the output is sent back to the server.

Server script should run on attacker machine and client script on victims machine

Edit script as per your requirement before running it
